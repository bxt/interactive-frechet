Interactive Fréchet Distance Calculation
========================================

[See in action](http://bernhardhaeussner.de/odd/interactive-frechet).

This is a [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)-base interactive animation, which shows
a free-space diagram as used in the calculation of the [Fréchet distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance) of two line segments.

Imagine a dog and its owner walking along two separate line segments. The leash
may only expand to a maximum length. The percentages of the line lengths, at which the leash is suffieicenty long are plotted as an ellipse.
